<abbr title="Pour Une IA Francophone">Piaf</abbr> is an open-source QA (question answering) annotation plateform.  
It handles the following features :  
* nice UI (conceived by a designer)
* contributor enrollment (signup & mail validation)
* contributor certification (by any member of the _admin_ team)
* _admin_ team administration (by the super-admin)
* input/output of texts to be annotated using the SQuAD format
* users scoring (for bot and troll removal)
* annotations managment


## 1. Installation

First clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etalab/piaf.git
cd piaf
```

Then you have tow options : install the app with Docker or without

### Installing with Docker-Compose

As a prerequisite, you need to have installed Docker & Docker-compose on your computer.

Then, type:

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### Installing without

As a prerequisite, you need to have installed on your computer:

* Python 3.6+
* Django 2.1.7+
* Node.js 8.0+
* Chromium (recommended)


First install Python dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev  # Linux/Debian only
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then compile the frontend:

```bash
make build-statics
```

> When developing the frontend, you may prefer watching for files changes.
> Run `npm start` (instead of `npm run build`) for building and hot reloading.

## 2. Running

### Running the server for development

Letâ€™s start the development server and explore it.
Depending on your installation method above, there are two options:

### Running through Docker-Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Running Django manually

First prepare the database:

```bash
cd src
python manage.py migrate
```

Then create the admin user:

```bash
python manage.py create_admin --noinput --username "admin" --email "admin@example.com" --password "password"
```

And finally run the Django server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

> Note that Django permits to run the server on a different IP or port. `python manage.py runserver <ip>:<port>`

## 3. Creating a project

Open your web-browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ and login with the admin you created above (username: "admin", password: "password"):

You will then need to create a project on the admin panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin

You can create various kinds of projects. Onle the **questions/answers** project is considered here.
If you are interested in others kinds of projects you should visit [doccano](https://github.com/chakki-works/doccano) from which Piaf is forked.


### Running the tests

```bash
python manage.py test server.tests
```


### Importing texts

Go to : http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin

2 types of files can be imported:
- `CSV file`: must include a header with a "text" column or must be a single column file.
- `JSON file`: each row must be a JSON object including a "text" key. Note that JSON format is line-breaks friendly.

`example.csv` (or `example.txt`):

```python
EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.
He lives in Newark, Ohio.
...
```

`example.json`:

```JSON
{"text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb."}
{"text": "He lives in Newark, Ohio."}
...
```

If any other column (or key in a JSON file) is present they are saved as _metadata_.

### Annotation

Simply reach : http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/


### Exporing results

Again, on the page : http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/admin

Possible formats are CSV or JSON.

> All documents have a _metadata_ column which contain data about the imported document.
> These _metadata_ are especially useful to match imported results with the original dataset.
> Example:

`import.json`:

```JSON
{"text": "EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb.", "external_id": 1}
```

`output.json`:

```JSON
{"doc_id": 16, "text": "EU rejects calls", "labels": ["news"], "username": "user23", "metadata": {"external_id": 1}}
```

## configuration

Passing most settings as environment variable will override the default settings.

Example:
```
DEBUG=0 MATOMO_SITE_ID=77 src/manage.py runserver
```

Will disable debugging and activate Matomo tracking.
